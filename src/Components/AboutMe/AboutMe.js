                            Welcome to my page! My name is Joseph J Lyons, I am thirty-years-old.

                            I recently decided to change my career path and learn how to program and code. Prior to
                            making this decision I was a dedicated chef and well established in the restaurant
                            community. I still enjoy cooking and can still produce some stellar dishes, but only for
                            family and friends these days.

                            In my spare time I enjoy a variety of activities. You can find me golfing, boating on Lake
                            Winnipesaukee or watching the Boston Bruins. I enjoy spending time with friends, having some
                            adult beverages, grilling food and playing lawn games.
                           
                            I decided to switch my career path for a few reasons. The physical toll of the restaurant
                            industry is extremely taxing, and I decided that it was time to devote myself to a field
                            with increasing opportunities for growth.
                            
                            I look forward to spending my time and energy learning how to write and produce functioning
                            code. I donâ€™t think that this change is going to come easy, but l anticipate the ability to
                            challenge myself and work hard to have a successful career.
